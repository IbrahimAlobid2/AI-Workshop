## lesson 1 

This session provides a comprehensive introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI), covering its core concepts, components, and its various branches. The session also dives into the fundamentals of Generative AI (GenAI), a rapidly evolving area within the field. We will explore how AI systems learn, how machine learning models are trained, and how different learning modes, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, function. Additionally, the session provides insights into the working mechanisms of Transformers, a key technology used in Large Language Models (LLMs), and how they are trained to perform language-based tasks.

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction.
  
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: This subfield of AI focuses on algorithms capable of generating new content such as images, text, or audio. GenAI leverages advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning to create outputs that mimic human-like creativity.

- **Training and Learning Modes**: AI systems learn by processing data, and there are different learning paradigms:
  - **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each input.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: The model identifies patterns in data without labeled outputs.
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

- **Transformers and LLMs**: Transformers are a type of deep learning model used extensively in natural language processing (NLP). They are designed to handle sequential data efficiently, and their attention mechanism allows them to focus on relevant parts of input data. This architecture is the backbone of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, which excel in tasks like language translation, summarization, and content generation.
